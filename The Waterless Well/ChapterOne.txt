There was a well, down by the mountain sides. No one knew why it was there, or why it even came to be. No sane townsfolk would ever dare to cross the harsh landscapes for a measly bucket of water. Nevertheless, the well stood there steadily, unmovable from blizzards nor earthquakes alike. Days, and months would go by, and the townsfolk would gaze down into the steep valley, and the well would always be there. Steady, quiet, 'resilient' some would say.

Of course, it was a day like any other, when Liyue pondered on the peculiar sight of the lonely well.
